    "Q1. Explain the assumptions required to use ANOVA and provide examples of violations that could impact the validity of the results.\n",
    "ANS-There are three primary assumptions in ANOVA:\n",
    "The responses for each factor level have a normal population distribution.\n",
    "These distributions have the same variance.\n",
    "The data are independent.\n",
    "ANOVA tells you if the dependent variable changes according to the level of the independent variable. For example: Your independent variable is social media use, and you assign groups to low, medium, and high levels of social media use to find out if there is a difference in hours of sleep per night.\n",
    "Q2. What are the three types of ANOVA, and in what situations would each be used?\n",
    "ANS-This test is also called the Fisher analysis of variance. The use of ANOVA depends on the research design. Commonly, ANOVAs are used in three ways: one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, and N-way ANOVA.\n",
    "ANOVA tells you if the dependent variable changes according to the level of the independent variable. For example: Your independent variable is social media use, and you assign groups to low, medium, and high levels of social media use to find out if there is a difference in hours of sleep per night.\n",
    "he three-way ANOVA is used by statisticians to determine whether there is a three-way relationship among variables on an outcome. It determines what effect, if any, three factors had on an outcome.\n",
    "Q3. What is the partitioning of variance in ANOVA, and why is it important to understand this concept?\n",
    "ANS-An ANOVA uses an F-test to evaluate whether the variance among the groups is greater than the variance within a group. Another way to view this problem is that we could partition variance, that is, we could divide the total variance in our data into the various sources of that variation.Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a statistical technique used to check if the means of two or more groups are significantly different from each other. ANOVA checks the impact of one or more factors by comparing the means of different samples.\n",
    "Budget variance analysis helps to reveal where your business exceeded expectations and where it came up short. Predictive budgeting can also help. The process of analyzing the variances reveals processes, initiatives, and other activities that created positive or negative results.\n",
    "Q4. How would you calculate the total sum of squares (SST), explained sum of squares (SSE), and residual sum of squares (SSR) in a one-way ANOVA using Python?\n",
    "ANS-Here we utilize the property that the treatment sum of squares plus the error sum of squares equals the total sum of squares. Hence, SSE = SS(Total) - SST = 45.349 - 27.897 = 17.45 \\, .\n",
    "Step 1: Calculate the mean of the sample. Step 2: Subtract the mean from each sample value, and square each difference. Step 3: Sum these squared differences to calculate the Total Sum of Squares (SST).\n",
    "The Mean Sum of Squares between the groups, denoted MSB, is calculated by dividing the Sum of Squares between the groups by the between group degrees of freedom. That is, MSB = SS(Between)/(m−1).\n",
    "SSR = Σ( – y)2 = SST – SSE. Regression sum of squares is interpreted as the amount of total variation that is explained by the model. r2 = 1 – SSE/SST = (SST – SSE)/SST = SSR/SST the ratio of explained variation to total variation.\n",
    "Q5. In a two-way ANOVA, how would you calculate the main effects and interaction effects using Python?\n",
    "ANS-Step 1: Calculate Sum of Squares for First Factor (Watering Frequency) ...\n",
    "Step 2: Calculate Sum of Squares for Second Factor (Sunlight Exposure) ...\n",
    "Step 3: Calculate Sum of Squares Within (Error) ...\n",
    "Step 4: Calculate Total Sum of Squares. ...\n",
    "Step 5: Calculate Sum of Squares Interaction.\n",
    "Formally, main effects are the mean differences for a single Independent variable. There is always one main effect for each IV. A 2x2 design has 2 IVs, so there are two main effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Suppose you conducted a one-way ANOVA and obtained an F-statistic of 5.23 and a p-value of 0.02.\n",
    "What can you conclude about the differences between the groups, and how would you interpret these results?\n",
    "ANS-The F-statistic is simply a ratio of two variances. Variances are a measure of dispersion, or how far the data are scattered from the mean. Larger values represent greater dispersion\n",
    "The test statistic is F=MSTMSE with (since n=33 and K=3) degrees of freedom df1=K−1=3−1=2 and df2=n−K=33−3=30\n",
    "A significance level of 0.05 indicates a 5% risk of concluding that a difference exists when there is no actual difference. If the p-value is less than or equal to the significance level, you reject the null hypothesis and conclude that not all population means are equal.\n",
    "To determine whether any of the differences between the means are statistically significant, compare the p-value to your significance level to assess the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis states that the population means are all equal. Usually, a significance level (denoted as α or alpha) of 0.05 works well.\n",
    "Q7. In a repeated measures ANOVA, how would you handle missing data, and what are the potential consequences of using different methods to handle missing data?\n",
    "ANS-With repeated measures ANOVA, you can't use any of the data for that subject. To do repeated measures ANOVA, you'd need to remove the data for that participant/animal/whatever entirely from the data table before running the ANOVA.\n",
    "One of the most effective ways of dealing with missing data is multiple imputation (MI). Using MI, we can create multiple plausible replacements of the missing data, given what we have observed and a statistical model (the imputation model)\n",
    "ANOVA test, in its simplest form, is used to check whether the means of three or more populations are equal or not. The ANOVA test applies when there are more than two independent groups. The goal of the ANOVA test is to check for variability within the groups as well as the variability among the groups.\n",
    "Q8. What are some common post-hoc tests used after ANOVA, and when would you use each one? Provide an example of a situation where a post-hoc test might be necessary.\n",
    "ANS-The Bonferroni is probably the most commonly used post hoc test, because it is highly flexible, very simple to compute, and can be used with any type of statistical test (e.g., correlations)—not just post hoc tests with ANOVA.\n",
    "If an ANOVA produces a p-value that is less than our significance level, we can use post hoc tests to find out which group means differ from one another. Post hoc tests allow us to control the family-wise error rate while performing multiple pairwise comparisons.\n",
    "A post hoc test is used only after we find a statistically significant result and need to determine where our differences truly came from. The term “post hoc” comes from the Latin for “after the event”. There are many different post hoc tests that have been developed, and most of them will give us similar answers.\n",
    "Q9. A researcher wants to compare the mean weight loss of three diets: A, B, and C. They collect data from 50 participants who were randomly assigned to one of the diets.
