    "Q1: What is Estimation Statistics? Explain point estimate and interval estimate.\n",
    "ANS-A point estimate is a single value estimate of a parameter. For instance, a sample mean is a point estimate of a population mean. An interval estimate gives you a range of values where the parameter is expected to lie. A confidence interval is the most common type of interval estimate.\n",
    "A point estimate of a parameter θ is a value (based on a sample) that is a sensible guess for θ. A point estimate is obtained by a formula (“estimator”) which takes the sample data and produces an point estimate. Such formulas are called point estimators of θ.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Write a Python function to estimate the population mean using a sample mean and standard deviation.\n",
    "ANS-The statistics module in python provides functions called stdev() and pstdev() to calculate the standard deviation of a sample dataset. The stdev() function in python only calculates the sample standard deviation whereas the pstdev() function calculates the population standard deviation.\n",
    "Python Scipy stats module can be used to create a normal distribution with meand and standard deviation parameters using method norm. Standard normal distribution is normal distribution with mean as 0 and standard deviation as 1.\n",
    "Q3: What is Hypothesis testing? Why is it used? State the importance of Hypothesis testing.\n",
    "ANS-Hypothesis testing is used to assess the plausibility of a hypothesis by using sample data. The test provides evidence concerning the plausibility of the hypothesis, given the data. Statistical analysts test a hypothesis by measuring and examining a random sample of the population being analyzed.\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is the process used to evaluate the strength of evidence from the sample and provides a framework for making determinations related to the population, ie, it provides a method for understanding how reliably one can extrapolate observed findings in a sample under study to the larger population from \n",
    "After developing your initial research hypothesis (the prediction that you want to investigate), it is important to restate it as a null (Ho) and alternate (Ha) hypothesis so that you can test it mathematically. The alternate hypothesis is usually your initial hypothesis that predicts a relationship between variables\n",
    "Q4. Create a hypothesis that states whether the average weight of male college students is greater than the average weight of female college students.\n",
    "ANS-A z-test is used to test a Null Hypothesis if the population variance is known, or if the sample size is larger than 30, for an unknown population variance. A t-test is used when the sample size is less than 30 and the population variance is unknown\n",

    "Q6: What is a null and alternative hypothesis? Give some examples.\n",
    "ANS-A null hypothesis is a statement about a population parameter that we wish to test for statistical significance. It is often denoted as H0 and represents the status quo or default position, assuming that there is no significant difference or relationship between the variables being tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative hypothesis, denoted as Ha, is a statement that contradicts the null hypothesis, and represents the possibility that there is a significant difference or relationship between the variables being tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of null and alternative hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example for a one-sample hypothesis test:\n",
    "Null hypothesis: The mean IQ score of a population is 100.\n",
    "Alternative hypothesis: The mean IQ score of a population is not 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example for a two-sample hypothesis test:\n",
    "Null hypothesis: The mean height of men is the same as the mean height of women.\n",
    "Alternative hypothesis: The mean height of men is different from the mean height of women.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example for a correlation hypothesis test:\n",
    "Null hypothesis: There is no significant correlation between age and income.\n",
    "Alternative hypothesis: There is a significant correlation between age and income.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of these examples, the null hypothesis represents the absence of a significant effect or relationship, while the alternative hypothesis represents the possibility of a significant effect or relationship. The hypothesis test is designed to determine which of these two hypotheses is supported by the evidence in the data.\n",
    "Q7: Write down the steps involved in hypothesis testing.\n",
    "ANS-Here are the general steps involved in hypothesis testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. State the null and alternative hypotheses: Clearly define the null and alternative hypotheses based on the research question and prior knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Select the significance level: Choose the level of significance (alpha), typically set at 0.05, which represents the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Choose the appropriate test statistic: Select the appropriate test statistic based on the nature of the hypothesis test, sample size, and type of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Collect and analyze the data: Collect the sample data and perform the necessary calculations to obtain the test statistic and the p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Make a decision: Compare the p-value to the significance level, and determine whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Draw conclusions: Interpret the results of the hypothesis test, and draw conclusions about the population parameter of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Communicate the results: Report the results of the hypothesis test, including the test statistic, p-value, and conclusion, in a clear and concise manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the specific steps involved in hypothesis testing may vary depending on the type of hypothesis test being conducted and the statistical software or programming language being used. However, these general steps provide a framework for conducting hypothesis tests and making statistical inferences based on sample data.\n",
    "Q8. Define p-value and explain its significance in hypothesis testing.\n",
    "ANS-The p-value is a measure of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis in a hypothesis test. It represents the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the p-value tells us how likely it is to observe the data we have if the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value indicates that it is unlikely to observe such data if the null hypothesis is true, and therefore provides evidence against the null hypothesis. Conversely, a large p-value suggests that the data are consistent with the null hypothesis, and there is insufficient evidence to reject it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance level (alpha) is typically set at 0.05, which means that if the p-value is less than 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a statistically significant difference or relationship between the variables being tested. If the p-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is not enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the p-value does not tell us the size or practical importance of the effect or relationship being tested, but rather indicates whether the effect or relationship is statistically significant or not. Additionally, the p-value is affected by the sample size, significance level, and assumptions of the statistical test being used, so it should be interpreted carefully in the context of the specific hypothesis test being conducted.\n",

    "Q11: What is Student’s t distribution? When to use the t-Distribution.\n",
    "ANS-Student's t-distribution is a probability distribution that is used in hypothesis testing when the sample size is small or when the population variance is unknown. It is similar to the normal distribution but has heavier tails and more probability in the tails, which makes it more appropriate for small sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-distribution is used when the population standard deviation is unknown and must be estimated from the sample standard deviation. It is also used when the sample size is small (typically less than 30) and the population distribution is not normal, but the sample is approximately normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-distribution is commonly used in hypothesis testing for testing the difference between two means, testing whether a sample mean is significantly different from a population mean, or testing the significance of a correlation coefficient. The t-distribution is also used in confidence interval estimation for a population mean when the sample size is small or the population variance is unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the t-distribution is a statistical tool used in situations where the population variance is unknown and the sample size is small. It provides a way to estimate the population mean and assess the significance of the difference between sample means.\n",
    "Q12: What is t-statistic? State the formula for t-statistic.\n",
    "ANS-The t-statistic is a measure of how different the sample mean is from the hypothesized population mean, in units of the standard error of the sample mean. It is used to test hypotheses about the population mean when the population standard deviation is unknown and must be estimated from the sample.\n",

    "The t-statistic is calculated by subtracting the hypothesized population mean from the sample mean, then dividing the result by the standard error of the sample mean. The standard error of the sample mean is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean, which is calculated as the sample standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting t-statistic measures how many standard errors the sample mean is from the hypothesized population mean. If the t-statistic is large, it suggests that the sample mean is significantly different from the hypothesized population mean, and we may reject the null hypothesis that the sample mean is equal to the population mean. If the t-statistic is small, it suggests that the sample mean is not significantly different from the hypothesized population mean, and we may fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
