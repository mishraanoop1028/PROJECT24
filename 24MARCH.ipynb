    "ANS-According to experts, the wine is differentiated according to its smell, flavor, and color, but we are not a wine expert to say that wine is good or bad. What will we do then? Here’s the use of Machine Learning comes, yes you are thinking to write we are using machine learning to check wine quality. ML have some techniques that will discuss below:\n",

    "fixed acidity :   Primary fixed acids found in wine are tartaric, succinic, citric, and malic\n",

    "Missing data can be dealt with in a variety of ways. I believe the most common reaction is to ignore it. Choosing to make no decision, on the other hand, indicates that your statistical programme will make the decision for you.\n",

    "Your application will remove things in a listwise sequence most of the time. Depending on why and how much data is gone, listwise deletion may or may not be a good idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common strategy among those who pay attention is imputation. Imputation is the process of substituting an estimate for missing values and analysing the entire data set as if the imputed values were the true observed values.\n",

    "Something else that is completely different is how much data we have at our fingertips. What was once scarce is now a seemingly overwhelming amount of data. But, it’s only overwhelming if you don’t know data analysis to find true and insightful meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do you go from point A, having a vast amount of data, to point B, being able to accurately interpret that data? It all comes down to using the right methods for statistical analysis, which is how we process and collect samples of data to uncover patterns and trends.\n",

    "Q4. Describe the process of feature engineering in the context of the student performance data set. How\n",
    "did you select and transform the variables for your model?\n",
    "ANS-Feature engineering is the process of selecting, manipulating, and transforming raw data into features that can be used in supervised learning. In order to make machine learning work well on new tasks, it might be necessary to design and train better features. As you may know, a “feature” is any measurable input that can be used in a predictive model — it could be the color of an object or the sound of someone’s voice. Feature engineering, in simple terms, is the act of converting raw observations into desired features using statistical or machine learning approaches.\n",
