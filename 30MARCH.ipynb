    "ANS-Elastic net linear regression uses the penalties from both the lasso and ridge techniques to regularize regression models. The technique combines both the lasso and ridge regression methods by learning from their shortcomings to improve the regularization of statistical models.\n",
    "Lasso will eliminate many features, and reduce overfitting in your linear model. Ridge will reduce the impact of features that are not important in predicting your y values. Elastic Net combines feature elimination from Lasso and feature coefficient reduction from the Ridge model to improve your model's predictions.\n"
