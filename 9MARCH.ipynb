    "Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are both mathematical functions that describe the probability distribution of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PMF is a function that gives the probability of each possible value that a discrete random variable can take on. It maps each value to its probability, and the sum of all probabilities equals 1. For example, consider a fair six-sided die. The PMF of the random variable X that represents the outcome of rolling the die can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X = 1) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 2) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 3) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 4) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 5) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 6) = 1/6\n",
    "\n",
    "This PMF tells us that the probability of rolling a 1 is 1/6, the probability of rolling a 2 is 1/6, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the PDF is a function that gives the relative likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a certain value. Unlike the PMF, the PDF does not give the probability of a specific value, but rather the probability density, which can be thought of as the probability per unit of measurement. The area under the PDF curve between any two values gives the probability of the random variable taking on values between those two points. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the height of adult men in a population. The PDF of the random variable X that represents the height of a randomly selected man can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "f(x) = k * e^(-((x - μ)^2)/(2σ^2))\n",
    "\n",
    "where k is a constant that ensures that the area under the curve equals 1, μ is the mean height, and σ is the standard deviation of the population. This PDF tells us the relative likelihood of a man having a certain height, and the probability of a man having a height between any two values can be found by integrating the PDF between those two values."

    "Q2: What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why CDF is used?\n",
    "ANS-\n",
    "\n",
    "A Cumulative Density Function (CDF) is a function that gives the cumulative probability of a random variable taking on a value less than or equal to a specific value. In other words, the CDF gives the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to a given value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a discrete random variable, the CDF is defined as the sum of the probabilities of all the values less than or equal to the given value. For a continuous random variable, the CDF is defined as the integral of the probability density function (PDF) from negative infinity to the given value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following PMF of a random variable X:\n",
    "\n",
    "X     |  0   |  1   |  2   |  3\n",
    "------|-----|-----|-----|-----\n",
    "P(X) | 0.2 | 0.3 | 0.4 | 0.1\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF of X can be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "F(x) = P(X ≤ x)\n",

    "F(0) = P(X ≤ 0) = 0.2\n",

    "F(2) = P(X ≤ 2) = 0.2 + 0.3 + 0.4 = 0.9\n",
    "F(3) = P(X ≤ 3) = 0.2 + 0.3 + 0.4 + 0.1 = 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the probability of X being less than or equal to 0 is 0.2, the probability of X being less than or equal to 1 is 0.5, the probability of X being less than or equal to 2 is 0.9, and the probability of X being less than or equal to 3 is 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF is used to find probabilities and percentiles of a random variable. For example, the probability that a random variable takes on a value between two given values can be found by subtracting the CDF at the lower value from the CDF at the higher value. Similarly, the percentile of a specific value can be found by finding the value of the random variable that corresponds to the desired percentile using the inverse of the CDF."

    "\n",
    "The parameters of the normal distribution are the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ). The mean represents the center of the distribution and determines where the peak of the distribution is located. The standard deviation determines the spread of the distribution around the mean. A larger standard deviation results in a wider and flatter distribution, while a smaller standard deviation results in a narrower and taller distribution.\n",

    "The shape of the normal distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped, with the peak located at the mean. The curve approaches but never touches the horizontal axis, and the total area under the curve is equal to 1.

    "Distribution. \n",
    "ANS-The Normal Distribution is a probability distribution that is widely used in many fields of study, especially in statistics and data analysis. Its importance lies in the fact that it is a good model for many real-life phenomena, allowing for accurate predictions and reliable statistical analysis. Some of the reasons for the importance of Normal Distribution are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Central Limit Theorem: One of the most important properties of the Normal Distribution is that it is the limit distribution of the sum of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables. This is known as the Central Limit Theorem, and it allows for the use of Normal Distribution to approximate the distribution of many real-life phenomena, even if the underlying distribution is not Normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Symmetry and Bell-Shaped Curve: The Normal Distribution has a symmetric and bell-shaped curve, which makes it a good model for many real-life phenomena that exhibit similar characteristics. This includes data related to human height, weight, IQ scores, exam scores, and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Ease of Computation: The Normal Distribution is easy to work with mathematically, making it a popular choice for statistical analysis. It allows for easy calculations of probabilities, means, and standard deviations, which are key measures of central tendency and variability in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-life examples of Normal Distribution include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Heights of people in a population: The heights of people in a population tend to follow a Normal Distribution, with the majority of people clustering around the mean height and fewer people at the extreme ends of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Exam scores: In a large population of students taking the same exam, their scores tend to follow a Normal Distribution. This allows for the calculation of the average and standard deviation of the scores, which are useful measures of central tendency and variability.\n",

    "3. Monthly stock returns: The monthly returns of a stock or portfolio tend to follow a Normal Distribution, with most months having average returns around the mean and fewer months with extreme high or low returns.\n",

    "4. IQ scores: IQ scores are standardized test scores that are designed to follow a Normal Distribution, with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. This allows for easy comparisons of scores across populations and makes it easier to identify individuals with exceptional intelligence."

    "Q5: What is Bernaulli Distribution? Give an Example. What is the difference between Bernoulli\n",
    "Distribution and Binomial Distribution?\n",
    "ANS-The Bernoulli Distribution is a probability distribution that describes the outcomes of a single binary event (i.e., an event that can have only two possible outcomes). It is named after Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli, who first introduced the concept in his work \"Ars Conjectandi\" in 1713.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bernoulli Distribution has only one parameter, which is the probability of success (usually denoted by p). The probability of failure is simply 1-p. The possible outcomes of a Bernoulli trial are often represented as 0 for failure and 1 for success.\n",

It is used when we repeat the same binary event multiple times and count the number of successes. The Binomial Distribution has two parameters: the number of trials (n) and the probability of success in each trial (p).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between Bernoulli Distribution and Binomial Distribution is that Bernoulli is concerned with the outcome of a single trial, whereas Binomial is concerned with the number of successes in a fixed number of trials. In other words, Bernoulli is a special case of the Binomial Distribution where n=1. Another key difference is that the Bernoulli Distribution has only two possible outcomes, whereas the Binomial Distribution has a range of possible outcomes from 0 to n.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of Binomial Distribution could be the number of heads obtained when a coin is flipped 10 times. Each flip is a Bernoulli trial, with the probability of success (getting a head) being p. The Binomial Distribution can then be used to calculate the probability of getting a certain number of heads (e.g., 2, 5, or 8) out of the 10 flips."
