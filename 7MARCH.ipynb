    "\n",
    "The mean is the sum of all the values in a dataset divided by the total number of values.

However, the mean can be sensitive to outliers, which are extreme values that are far away from the rest of the dataset.\n",

    "The mode is the most common value in a dataset. It is a useful measure when the dataset has a discrete distribution, meaning that the data points only take certain values. The mode can be used to identify the most frequent category in a dataset.\n",

    "In practice, all three measures of central tendency are used to describe a dataset. The choice of which measure to use depends on the distribution of the data and the research question being asked. For example, if the data has a normal distribution, the mean is often used as the measure of central tendency. If the data is skewed, the median may be a better representation of the central value. The mode is useful when looking at categorical data or when trying to identify the most common value in a dataset."

    "ANS-Measures of dispersion are used to describe the spread or variability of a dataset. They provide information about how much the data points in a dataset differ from each other. The most common measures of dispersion are range, variance, and standard deviation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Variance and standard deviation are more precise measures of dispersion. Variance is the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean of the dataset. Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. They are more useful than range as they give more weight to the spread of data around the mean and are less sensitive to outliers.\n",

    "A dataset is said to be skewed if it is not symmetric, meaning that the distribution has a longer tail on one side than the other.

For example, the mean of a positively skewed dataset will be greater than the median, whereas the mean of a negatively skewed dataset will be less than the median. This means that depending on the skewness of the data, different measures of central tendency may be more appropriate. Skewness can also impact the accuracy of statistical tests and confidence intervals, so it is important to assess and address any skewness in the data before performing any analyses."

This is because in a right-skewed distribution, the tail of the distribution is on the right side, and it contains a few extreme values that are much larger than the rest of the data. These extreme values can pull the mean to the right, towards the tail, making it larger than the median. On the other hand, the median is less affected by extreme values and is more representative of the typical value in the dataset. As a result, the median tends to be closer to the bulk of the data, which is typically on the left side of the distribution, and less influenced by the extreme values on the right."
