    "Q1. What is data encoding? How is it useful in data science?\n",
    "ANS-Encoding is the process of converting the data or a given sequence of characters, symbols, alphabets etc., into a specified format, for the secured transmission of data. Decoding is the reverse process of encoding which is to extract the information from the converted format.\n",
    "Q2. What is nominal encoding? Provide an example of how you would use it in a real-world scenario.\n",
    "ANS-When we have a feature where variables are just names and there is no order or rank to this variable's feature.\n",
    "For example: City of person lives in, Gender of person, Marital Status, etc…\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, We do not have any order or rank, or sequence. All the variables in the respective feature are equal. We can't give them any orders or ranks. Those features are called Nominal features\n",
    "Q3. In what situations is nominal encoding preferred over one-hot encoding? Provide a practical example.\n",
    "ANS-Encoding is another popular technique for treating categorical variables. It simply creates additional features based on the number of unique values in the categorical feature. Every unique value in the category will be added as a feature.\n",
    "Assume we have a sequence of labels with the values 'red' and 'green'. We can assign 'red' an integer value of 0 and 'green' the integer value of 1. As long as we always assign these numbers to these labels, this is called an integer encoding\n",
    "Let X = {x1,x2,x3,……..,xn} be the set of observation and V = {v1,v2,…….,vc} be the set of centroids.\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomly select ‘c’ centroids(no. of centroids = no. of bins).\n",
    "Calculate the distance between each of the observations and centroids.\n",
    "Assign the observation to that centroid whose distance from the centroid is the minimum of all the centroids.\n",
    "Recalculate the new centroid using the mean(average) of all the points in the new cluster being formed.\n",
    "Recalculate the distance between each observation and newly obtained centroids.\n",
    "If no observation was reassigned in further steps then stop, otherwise, repeat from step third again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. In a machine learning project, you have a dataset with 1000 rows and 5 columns. Two of the columns\n",
    "are categorical, and the remaining three columns are numerical. If you were to use nominal encoding to\n",
    "transform the categorical data, how many new columns would be created? Show your calculations.\n",
    "ans-\n",
    "# import libraries\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    " \n",
    "# import the data required\n",
    "data = pd.read_csv(\"employee_data.csv\")\n",
    "print(data.head())\n",
    "Machine Learning algorithms cannot work with categorical data and needs to be converted into numerical data. Sometimes in datasets, we encounter columns that contain categorical features (string values) for example parameter Gender will have categorical parameters like Male, Female. These labels have no specific order of preference and also since the data is string labels, machine learning models misinterpreted that there is some sort of hierarchy in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. You are working with a dataset containing information about different types of animals, including their\n",
    "species, habitat, and diet. Which encoding technique would you use to transform the categorical data into\n",
    "a format suitable for machine learning algorithms? Justify your answer.\n",
    "ans-In Ordinal data, while encoding, one should retain the information regarding the order in which the category is provided. Like in the above example the highest degree a person possesses, gives vital information about his qualification. The degree is an important feature to decide whether a person is suitable for a post or not.An ordinal encoding involves mapping each unique label to an integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, it is sometimes referred to simply as an integer encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of encoding is really only appropriate if there is a known relationship between the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "This relationship does exist for some of the variables in the dataset, and ideally, this should be harnessed when preparing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7.You are working on a project that involves predicting customer churn for a telecommunications\n",
    "company. You have a dataset with 5 features, including the customer's gender, age, contract type,\n",
    "monthly charges, and tenure. Which encoding technique(s) would you use to transform the categorical\n",
    "data into numerical data? Provide a step-by-step explanation of how you would implement the encoding.\n",
    "Ans-The data set used in this article is available in the Kaggle (CC BY-NC-ND) and contains nineteen columns (independent variables) that indicate the characteristics of the clients of a fictional telecommunications corporation. The Churn column (response variable) indicates whether the customer departed within the last month or not. The class No includes the clients that did not leave the company last month, while the class Yes contains the clients that decided to terminate their relations with the company. The objective of the analysis is to obtain the relation between the customer’s characteristics and the churn.\n",
