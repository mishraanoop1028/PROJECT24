    "In Python, the `close()` function is used to close an opened file. It is important to close a file after using it because when a file is opened, it is stored in the computer's memory, and until it is closed, it takes up a portion of the memory. If a large number of files are left open at once, it can cause memory issues and slow down the program or even the entire system. \n",

    "Additionally, if a file is not closed after being used, any changes made to the file may not be saved. This is because any changes made to the file are first stored in the memory, and only when the file is closed, the changes are written to the disk. If the file is not closed, the changes will not be written to the disk and the file will remain unchanged. Therefore, it is important to close a file after using it to ensure that any changes made to the file are saved properly and that system resources are released."

    "The `with` statement in Python is used to ensure that a code block is executed in a controlled environment. When we use the `with` statement with `open()`, we can guarantee that the file is closed when the block inside the `with` statement is exited, even if there is an exception raised. This is because the `with` statement uses a context manager to automatically close the file once the block is exited.\n",

    "The advantage of using `with` statement and `open()` together is that we don't have to manually close the file as the `with` statement will take care of that for us. This prevents us from forgetting to close the file, which can lead to resource leaks or data corruption. Additionally, using the `with` statement with `open()` makes our code cleaner and more concise. \n",

    "\n",
    "In this example, the `with` statement is used to open the file 'example.txt' in read mode, and the `as` keyword is used to assign the file object to the variable `file`. Inside the `with` block, the `read()` function is used to read the contents of the file, which are then printed to the console. Once the block is exited, the file is automatically closed."
