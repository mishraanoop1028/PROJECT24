    "Q2.which type of   programming language does python support ?\n",
    "Ans.Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language.\n",
    "It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, \n",
    "and classes. It supports multiple programming\n",

    "\n",
    "Q5.Is python interpreted or compiled  ?\n",
    "Ans.Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code\n",

    "Q7.State a character used to give single-line comments in python ?\n",
    "Ans.We can write a single-line comment by adding a single # character\n",

    "\n",
    "Q14.How is memory managed in python ?\n",
    "Ans.As we know, Python uses the dynamic memory allocation which is managed by the \n",
    "Heap data structure. Memory Heap holds the objects and other data structures that \n",
    "will be used in the program. Python memory \n",
    "manager manages the allocation or de-allocation of the heap memory space through the API functions.\n",
