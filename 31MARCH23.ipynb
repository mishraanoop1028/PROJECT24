    "Q1. What are the key steps involved in building an end-to-end web application, from development to\n",
    "deployment on the cloud?\n",

    "ANS-\n",
    "The end-to-end product management process focuses on creating a product vision, developing a product and bringing new products to users, and following up on how they interact with it throughout the entire product lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web hosting allows individuals and businesses to make their websites accessible worldwide through the Internet (WWW). A business or individual must have their own computer or server for web hosting, however, under Cloud Hosting, websites are hosted on multiple interconnected web servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Like cloud-based solutions, hosted services are managed by a third-party provider and accessed via the internet. They also include SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS. Instead of a public cloud, hosted solutions rely on physical servers that the provider owns and maintains privately somewhere off the customer's premises.\n",
    "Cloud hosting is the ability to make applications and websites available on the internet using the cloud. Cloud hosting pools computing resources from a network of virtual and physical servers, allowing for greater scalability and flexibility to quickly make changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. How do you choose the right cloud provider for your application deployment, and what factors\n",
    "should you consider?\n",
    "ANS-As more and more IT systems are externalised, making sure you pick the right cloud providers has become critical to long-term success.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the available market is vast, with a myriad of providers offering an even larger number of services. From market giants like Microsoft, Amazon and Google through to smaller niche players offering bespoke services.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you select the right cloud provider from so many? The answer is a defined selection and procurement process appropriately weighted towards your unique set of needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weâ€™ve distilled the key factors into a definitive list of 8 consideration areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can effectively select a suitable provider you need to understand your specific business needs. This sounds pretty obvious, but clarifying your specific requirements and minimum expectations, in advance of assessing providers ensures you are comparing them all against your checklist, instead of comparing one against the other.  This is the quickest way to move from long list to short list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Armed with clarity on technical, service, security, data governance and service management requirements, you can more effectively interrogate your select group of potential providers.\n",

    "Q4. How do you design and build a responsive user interface for your web application, and what are\n",
    "some best practices to follow?\n",
    "ANS-Responsive web design is about offering a seamless experience on any device, and since different web browsers render web pages in different ways, websites must be tested to ensure that they're compatible with a variety of mobile and desktop web browsers.\n",

    "Q5. How do you integrate the machine learning model with the user interface for the Algerian Forest Fires\n",
    "project(which we discussed in class), and what APIs or libraries can you use for this purpose?\n",
    "ANS-Well, the first question arises as that why we even need Machine learning to predict forest fire in that particular area? So, yes the question is valid that despite having the experienced forest department who have been dealing with these issues for a long time why is there a need for ML, having said that answer is quite simple that the experienced forest department can check on 3-4 parameters from their human mind but ML on other hand can handle the numerous parameters whether it can be latitude, longitude, satellite, version, and whatnot, so dealing with this multi-relationship of a parameter that is responsible for the fire in the forest we do need ML for sure!\n",
