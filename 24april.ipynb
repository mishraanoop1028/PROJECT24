    "To understand this relationship, consider a dataset that has been centered around its mean. The variance of the data along a particular dimension is defined as the average squared distance of each data point from the mean along that dimension. When the data is projected onto a principal component, the variance of the data along that component can be calculated as the sum of the squared distances of each data point from the mean along the component, divided by the number of data points.\n",

    "In PCA, the variance of the data along a particular dimension determines the importance of that dimension in explaining the overall variance in the data. However, PCA also takes into account the correlations between different dimensions in the data, and identifies the principal components that capture the maximum amount of variance in the data as a whole, rather than just in individual dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a dataset with three dimensions: x, y, and z. If the data has high variance in the x dimension but low variance in the y and z dimensions, PCA may identify the x dimension as the first principal component, but it will also identify the second and third principal components as combinations of the y and z dimensions that capture the remaining variance in the data. This allows PCA to capture the overall structure of the data, rather than just the variance in individual dimensions.\n",
