    "Encoding is another popular technique for treating categorical variables. It simply creates additional features based on the number of unique values in the categorical feature. Every unique value in the category will be added as a feature.\n",

    "In mathematics and statistics, covariance is a measure of the relationship between two random variables. The metric evaluates how much – to what extent – the variables change together. In other words, it is essentially a measure of the variance between two variables.\n",
