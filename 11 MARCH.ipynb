    "Q1: What is the difference between a t-test and a z-test?\n",
    "Provide an example scenario where you would\n",
    "use each type of test\n",
    "ans- z-test is used to test a Null Hypothesis if the population\n",
    "variance is known, or if the sample size is larger than 30, for an unknown population variance. \n",
    "A t-test is used when the sample size is less than 30 and the population variance is unknown.\n",
    "Example 1: A teacher claims that the mean score of students in his class is greater than 82 with\n",
    "a standard deviation of 20. If a sample of 81 students was selected with a mean score of 90 then \n",
    "check if there is enough evidence to support this claim at a 0.05 significance level.\n",
    "The t-test is based on the Student's t-distribution, while the z-test is based on the assumption\n",
    "that the distribution of the sample means is normal. In the case of a t-test, the population\n",
    "variance must be unknown. However, the population variance must be known or assumed to be known \n",
    "in the case of a z-test.\n",
    "T-test refers to a type of parametric test that is applied to identify, how the means of two \n",
    "sets of data differ from one another when variance is not given. Z-test implies a hypothesis \n",
    "test which ascertains if the means of two datasets are different from each other when variance\n",
    "is given.\n",
    "Q2: Differentiate between one-tailed and two-tailed tests.\n",
    "ans-A one-tailed test is used to ascertain if there is any relationship between variables in\n",
    "a single direction, i.e. left or right. As against this, the two-tailed test is used to identify \n",
    "whether or not there is any relationship between variables in either direction.\n",
    "The main difference between one-tailed and two-tailed tests is that one-tailed tests will only \n",
    "have one critical region whereas two-tailed tests will have two critical regions. If we require\n",
    "a 100(1−α) 100 ( 1 − α ) % confidence interval we have to make some adjustments when using a \n",
    "two-tailed test.\n",
    "The one-tail P value is half the two-tail P value. The two-tail P value is twice the one-tail\n",
    "P value (assuming you correctly predicted the direction of the difference). This rule works \n",
    "perfectly for almost all statistical tests.\n",
    "Q3: Explain the concept of Type 1 and Type 2 errors in hypothesis testing. Provide an example \n",
    "scenario for each type of error.\n",
    "ans-There are two errors that could potentially occur: Type I error (false positive): the test\n",
    "result says you have coronavirus, but you actually don't. Type II error (false negative): the \n",
    "test result says you don't have coronavirus, but you actually do.\n",
    "\n",
    "A type II error produces a false negative, also known as an error of omission. For example, a\n",
    "test for a disease may report a negative result when the patient is infected. This is a type\n",
    "II error because we accept the conclusion of the test as negative, even though it is incorrect.\n",
    "Drug 23 will significantly reduce symptoms associated with Disease A compared to Drug 22. For our\n",
    "example, if we were to state that Drug 23 significantly reduced symptoms of Disease A compared to\n",
    "Drug 22 when it did not, this would be a type I error.\n",
    "Q4:  Explain Bayes's theorem with an example.\n",
    "ANS-Bayes theorem gives the probability of an “event” with the given information on “tests”.\n",
    "There is a difference between “events” and “tests”. For example there is a test for liver disease,\n",
    "which is different from actually having the liver disease, i.e. an event. Rare events might be \n",
    "having a higher false positive rate.\n",
    "P(A AND B) is the conditional probability of event A occurring, given that B is true. P(B ∣ A)\n",
    "is the conditional probability of event B occurring, given that A is true. P(A) and P(B) are\n",
    "the probabilities of A and B occurring independently of one another.\n",
    "Q5: What is a confidence interval? How to calculate the confidence interval, explain with an \n",
    "example.\n",
    "ANS-A confidence interval is a range of values, bounded above and below the statistic's mean, \n",
    "that likely would contain an unknown population parameter. Confidence level refers to the \n",
    "percentage of probability, or certainty, that the confidence interval would contain the true\n",
    "population parameter when you draw a random sample many times.\n",
    " if you are estimating a 95% confidence interval around the mean proportion of female babies born\n",
    "    every year based on a random sample of babies, you might find an upper bound of 0.56 and a \n",
    "    lower bound of 0.48. These are the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval.\n",
    "    The confidence level is 95%.\n",
    "Q6. Use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of an event occurring given prior knowledge \n",
    "of the event's probability and new evidence. Provide a sample problem and solution.\n",
    "ANS-P(A|B) = P(B/A)P(A) / P(B). Your numerator is the probability of event B given event \n",
    "A multiplied by the probability of event A occurring on its own. You then divide this by \n",
    "the denominator of the probability of event B occurring on its own.\n",
    "In probability theory and statistics, Bayes' theorem (alternatively Bayes' law or Bayes' rule), \n",
    "named after Thomas Bayes, describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of \n",
    "conditions that might be related to the event.\n",
    "Q7. Calculate the 95% confidence interval for a sample of data with a mean of 50 and a standard\n",

    "interval, we use z=1.96, while for a 90% confidence interval, for example, we use z=1.64.\n",
    "A 95% confidence interval for the standard normal distribution, then, is the interval\n",
    "(-1.96, 1.96), since 95% of the area under the curve falls within this interval.\n",
    "Q8. What is the margin of error in a confidence interval? How does sample size affect\n",
    "the margin of error? Provide an example of a scenario where a larger sample size would \n",
    "result in a smaller margin of error.\n",
    "ANS-The margin of error is equal to half the width of the entire confidence interval.\n",
    "The width of the confidence interval is 18.5 – 12.5 = 6. The margin of error is equal\n",
    "to half the width, which would be 6/2 = 3.\n",
    "The doubling the sample size reduces the value of margin of error, and it increases the\n",
    "lower limit and reduces the upper limit. Hence, doubling the sample size reduces the confidence\n",
    "width, which means that the size of the confidence interval will reduce.\n",
