    "ANS-The main difference between the Euclidean distance metric and the Manhattan distance metric in KNN is the way they measure the distance between two data points in a multi-dimensional feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Euclidean distance is the shortest straight-line distance between two points in a feature space, and it is calculated by taking the square root of the sum of squared differences between corresponding feature values of the two points. It is often used when the features are continuous and have a natural metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the Manhattan distance, also known as the taxicab distance or L1 distance, is the sum of absolute differences between corresponding feature values of the two points. It is often used when the features are discrete or categorical, or when the direction of the differences between features is more important than their magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of distance metric can affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor. In general, the Euclidean distance metric tends to produce circular decision boundaries in the feature space, while the Manhattan distance metric tends to produce square or diamond-shaped decision boundaries. This means that the choice of distance metric can impact the shape of the decision boundary and the classification or regression performance of the KNN model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the Euclidean distance metric may be more sensitive to outliers and can suffer from the curse of dimensionality, where the distance between points becomes less meaningful in high-dimensional feature spaces. In contrast, the Manhattan distance metric is more robust to outliers and high-dimensional feature spaces, as it is less sensitive to differences in feature magnitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the choice of distance metric in KNN depends on the nature of the data and the specific problem at hand. It is often useful to experiment with both Euclidean and Manhattan distance metrics and choose the one that performs better on the given problem."
