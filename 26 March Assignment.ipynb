    "Q1.   Explain the difference between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression. Provide an\n",
    "   example of each.\n",
    "Ans  :-Simple linear regression has only one x and\n",
    " one y variable. Multiple linear regression has one\n",
    " y and two or more x variables.\n",
    " \n",
    " When we predict rent based on square feet and age of\n",
    " the building that is an example of multiple linear regression.\n",
    " \n",
    " In linear regression, every dependent value has a single\n",
    " corresponding\n",
    " independent variable that drives its value. For example,\n",
    " in the linear regression formula of y = 3x + 7, there is only one possible outcome of 'y' if 'x' is defined as 2.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    There are two main uses for multiple regression analysis. \n",
    "    The first is to determine the dependent variable based on\n",
    "    multiple independent variables. For example, you may be\n",
    "    interested in determining what a crop yield will be based on \n",
    "    temperature, rainfall, and other independent variables.\n",
    "    The second is to determine how strong the relationship is\n",
    "    between each variable. For example, you may be interested\n",
    "    in knowing how a crop yield will \n",
    "    change if rainfall increases or the temperature decreases.\n",

    "  Q2. Discuss the assumptions of linear regression. How can you\n",
    "  check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS-Assumptions in Regression\n",
    "Regression is a parametric approach.\n",
    "‘Parametric’ means it makes assumptions about \n",
    "data for the purpose of analysis. Due to its parametric side,\n",
    "regression is restrictive in nature. It fails to deliver good\n",
    "results with data sets which doesn’t fulfill its assumptions.\n",
    "Therefore, for a successful regression analysis, \n",
    "it’s essential to validate these assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "--There should be a linear and additive relationship between \n",
    "dependent\n",
    "(response) variable and independent (predictor) variable(s).\n",
    "A linear relationship suggests that a change in response Y due\n",
    "to one unit change in X¹ is constant, regardless of the value\n",
    "of X¹. An additive relationship suggests that the effect of X¹\n",
    "on Y is independent of other variables.\n",
    "There should be no correlation between the residual (error)\n",
    "terms. Absence of this phenomenon is known as Autocorrelation.\n",
    "The independent variables should not be correlated. Absence of\n",
    "this phenomenon is known as multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.3 How do you interpret the slope and intercept in a linear regression model? Provide an example using\n",
    "a real-world scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS--When modeling linear data, the slope and intercept \n",
    "of the graph provide useful information about the initial\n",
    "conditions and rate of change of what is being studied.\n",
    "First, the slope of a line is a measure of its steepness. \n",
    "In a line, slope is a ratio of the change in one variable\n",
    "to the change in the other. Usually, this refers to the change \n",
    "in y for each unit change in x, \n",
    "but sometimes other variables may be used.\n",
    "-The intercept refers to the y-intercept, \n",
    "which is where the line intersects the y-axis. Again, \n",
    "other variables may be used, but the intercept generally\n",
    "refers to the independent variable and the vertical axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Explain the concept of gradient descent.\n",
    "How is it used in machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS--Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm which\n",
    "is commonly-used to train machine learning models and neural\n",
    "networks. Training data helps these models learn over time,\n",
    "and the cost function within gradient descent specifically \n",
    "acts as a barometer, \n",
    "gauging its accuracy with each iteration of parameter updates.\n",
    "Gradient descent was initially discovered by \"Augustin-Louis \n",
    "Cauchy\" in mid of 18th century. Gradient Descent is defined as\n",
    "one of the most commonly used iterative optimization algorithms\n",
    "of machine learning to train the machine learning and deep\n",
    "learning models.\n",
    "It helps in finding the local minimum of a function.\n",

    "\n",
    "Q5. Describe the multiple linear regression model.\n",
    "How does it differ from simple linear regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS-There is just one x and one y variable in simple linear regression.\n",
    "There is one y variable and two or more x variables in multiple linear regression.\n",
    "Linear relationship: The independent variable, x, and the dependent variable, y, \n",
    "have a linear relationship.\n",
    "Independent residuals: The residuals are self-contained. In time series results,\n",
    "there is no connection between consecutive residuals in particular.\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: At any degree of x, the residuals have the same variance.\n",
    "Normality: The model’s residuals have a regular distribution.\n",
    "A multiple regression model is a linear regression model that has\n",
    "been expanded to include more than one\n",
    "independent variable. By logic, this means it performs better than a simple regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Explain the concept of multicollinearity in multiple linear regression. \n",
    "How can you detect and address this issue?\n",
    "ANS--Multicollinearity occurs when independent variables in a regression model\n",
    "are correlated. This correlation is a problem because independent variables should\n",
    "be independent. If the degree of correlation between variables is high enough, \n",
    "it can cause problems when you fit the model and interpret the results.\n",
    "The most straightforward method is to remove some variables that are highly\n",
    "correlated to others and leave the more significant ones in the set. For example,\n",
    "when we plot the correlation matrix with ‘SalePrice’ included, we can see that\n",
    "Overall Quality and Ground living area have the two highest correlations \n",
    "with the dependent variable ‘SalePrice’ and thus I will try to include them in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Describe the polynomial regression model. How is it different from linear regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS-Polynomial Regression is a one of the types of linear regression in which the\n",
    "relationship between the independent variable x and dependent variable y is modeled \n",
    "as an nth degree polynomial. Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship \n",
    "between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y, denoted E (y |x).\n",
    "Linear regression is a basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis which\n",
    "usually works on continuous data , linear regression in the above graph then the linear \n",
    "regression line won’t fit very well.\n",
    "It is very difficult to fit a linear regression line in the above graph with a low value of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. What are the advantages and disadvantages of polynomial regression compared to linear\n",
    "regression? In what situations would you prefer to use polynomial regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS--Advantages of using Polynomial Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Polynomial provides the best approximation of the relationship\n",
    "between the dependent and independent variable.\n",
    "A Broad range of function can be fit under it.\n",
    "Polynomial basically fits a wide range of curvature.\n",
    "Disadvantages of using Polynomial Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "The presence of one or two outliers in the data can seriously\n",
    "affect the results of the nonlinear analysis.\n",
    "These are too sensitive to the outliers.\n",
    "In addition, there are unfortunately fewer model validation tools\n",
    "for the detection of outliers in nonlinear regression than there \n",
    "are for linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Linear regression cannot be used to fit non-linear data (underfitting). \n",
    "Therefore, we increase the model’s complexity and use Polynomial regression, \n",
